# react-higlass-test
Test bench for HiGlass-based React application

## Setup

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Notes

Code is commented out in `src/Components/HgContainer/HgContainer.js` and `src/Constants.js` for a `higlass-transcripts` track. 

As shown in `package.json`, the transcripts plugin uses my customized fork as it depends on the `higlass-tabix-datafetcher` plugin.
